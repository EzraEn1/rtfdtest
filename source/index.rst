Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can start translating this wiki you will need to install a few programs and set up your environment to interface with the Github repository in order to collaborate with the wiki editors. You will need the following:

**Python Version 3.6 or higher**

Python is a programming language. You do not need to know any Python to help translating but we need the language installed to setup the environment.

| You can find the download here: `Python download <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
| The `Hitchhiker's Guide to Python <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/>`_ has a short tutorial on how to install python properly using the command line.
